# Photography-Portfolio

Hello there, I'm Harshith ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Chennai-based photographer. I specialize in travel photography and nailing the aesthetics. I have been getting my hands dirty since my college, doing event and fests coverage. And I'm the guy in group who takes thousands of photos, runs out of storage often and doesn't complain even after clicking tons of photos of the gang ( I'm trying to say I'm patient and reliable at the job)

When I'm not behind the camera, you can find me exploring the city's neighborhoods, trying out new restaurants, or spending time with my family and friends. I believe that every moment is an opportunity to experience something new and to create memories that will last a lifetime.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me and my work. If you're interested in collaborating or would like to see more of my portfolio, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Let's work together to bring your vision to life!
